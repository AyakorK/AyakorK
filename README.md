### ‚úçüèª Presentation
Hi there !
I'm Guillaume MORET, a young student that started code in 2021 and who's currently studying on the CodingFactory by ESIEE-IT.
I'm using few languages but I'm mainly attracted by Ruby and Ruby on Rails that became my main stacks because of my internship.
But to be fair, I'm actually really attracted by few languages like Rust, or even ReactJS.


### üíª Programming skills:
